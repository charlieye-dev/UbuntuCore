summary: Verify module loading is disabled

description: |
    As we're running pulseaudio in system mode (see https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/SystemWide/)
    for more details we have module loading disabled to prevent any client from loading malicious code into the daemon.

execute: |
    ! /snap/bin/pactl load-module module-null-sink
